##  🛠 How to Work with Shieldmail 🛠

Ready to dive in? Follow these steps to set up Project Name on your local machine for development and testing. We welcome code warriors 🗡️, wizards of the web 🧙‍♂️, and ninjas of new creations 🥷 to contribute to our quest for a spam-free realm!

## 📥 Cloning the Project

First, you'll need to clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer. Fire up your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following magical spell 🔮:

```
pip install gunicorn
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname


for windows users with Visual Studio code use the following comamnd to open it i nvisual studio: 

`code .`

🌟 Setting Up the Environment 🌈

Before diving into the magical world of Your Project Name, let's prepare your potion brewing station (a.k.a. development environment) to ensure everything works like a charm!

🧙‍♂️ Step 1: Install Python and pip

Make sure you have Python on your machine computer). If not, visit Python's official site to download and install it.

📝 Step 3: Install Dependencies

With a wave of your wand, install all the necessary spells (dependencies) from the requirements.txt scroll:

in the visual code terminal enter the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

🛡️ Step 4: Nginx Configuration as a Reverse Proxy 🚀

Now that your magical application is bubbling nicely in your cauldron, it's time to share it with the world! Let's set up Nginx as a protective charm (reverse proxy) to ensure that your app can handle a swarm of visitors without a hitch.

🧙‍♂️ Conjuring Nginx

First, if Nginx is not already guarding your server, summon it with:

`sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install nginx`


📜 Crafting the Spell (Configuration)

Navigate to the mystical lands of Nginx configurations:

`cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/ `

Use your favorite text editor to create a new scroll (file) named after your project:

`sudo nano yourprojectname`

Add the follwoing configuration:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Don't forget to enable your Nginx configuration in sites-enabled:

`sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourprojectname /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`

To check your Nginx configuration is working:


`sudo systemctl status nginx`

when makin gchanges, reload and erstart your nginx for the changes to take place:

`sudo systemctl restat nginx`

🚀 Step 5: Deploying with Gunicorn 🦄

After setting up Nginx as your reverse proxy, it’s time to conjure up Gunicorn, the Green Unicorn, to serve your Flask application to the world with grace and strength. Follow these steps to summon and configure Gunicorn.

📦 Install Gunicorn

If you haven't already, install Gunicorn by running the following enchantment in your terminal:


`pip install gunicorn`

🌟 Running Your Application with Gunicorn
Navigate to your project’s root directory, where your main Flask file (e.g., app.py) is located. Cast the following spell to awaken Gunicorn and start serving your application:


`gunicorn --workers=1 --bind filename:app`

if your file is app.py, instead of filename you will put app


🔒 Secure with HTTPS
Remember, if you’re using Nginx as a reverse proxy (as detailed in Step 4), configure it to forward requests to Gunicorn. Additionally, secure your application with SSL/TLS using Certbot for HTTPS encryption, keeping your users’ data safe from prying eyes.

🎉 Celebrate!
Your Flask application is now empowered by Gunicorn and guarded by Nginx, ready to dazzle users with its magical capabilities. Venture forth and spread your app’s charm across the digital realm!

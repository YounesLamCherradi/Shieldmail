🌟 Setting Up the Environment 🌈

Before diving into the magical world of Your Project Name, let's prepare your potion brewing station (a.k.a. development environment) to ensure everything works like a charm!

🧙‍♂️ Step 1: Install Python and pip

Make sure you have Python on your machine computer). If not, visit Python's official site to download and install it.

📝 Step 3: Install Dependencies

With a wave of your wand, install all the necessary spells (dependencies) from the requirements.txt scroll:

sudo apt install nginx`


📜 Crafting the Spell (Configuration)

Navigate to the mystical lands of Nginx configurations:

`cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/ `

Use your favorite text editor to create a new scroll (file) named after your project:

`sudo nano yourprojectname`

Add the follwoing configuration:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Don't forget to enable your Nginx configuration in sites-enabled:

`sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourprojectname /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`

To check your Nginx configuration is working:


`sudo systemctl status nginx`

when makin gchanges, reload and erstart your nginx for the changes to take place:

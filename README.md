## 🛠 How to Work with Shieldmail 🛠

Ready to dive in? Follow these steps to set up Project Name on your local machine for development and testing. We welcome code warriors 🗡️, wizards of the web 🧙‍♂️, and ninjas of new creations 🥷 to contribute to our quest for a spam-free realm!

### 📥 Cloning the Project

First, you'll need to clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer. Fire up your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following magical spell 🔮:

```
pip install gunicorn
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
```


###  📥 Cloning the Project
First, you'll need to clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer. Fire up your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following magical spell 🔮:

```
pip install gunicorn
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
```
for windows users with Visual Studio code use the following comamnd to open it i nvisual studio:

```
code .
```

🌟 Setting Up the Environment 🌈
Before diving into the magical world of Your Project Name, let's prepare your potion brewing station (a.k.a. development environment) to ensure everything works like a charm!

## 🧙‍♂️ Step 1: Install Python and pip
Make sure you have Python on your machine computer). If not, visit Python's official site to download and install it.

## 📝 Step 3: Install Dependencies
With a wave of your wand, install all the necessary spells (dependencies) from the requirements.txt scroll:

in the visual code terminal enter the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛡️ Step 4: Nginx Configuration as a Reverse Proxy 🚀
Now that your magical application is bubbling nicely in your cauldron, it's time to share it with the world! Let's set up Nginx as a protective charm (reverse proxy) to ensure that your app can handle a swarm of visitors without a hitch.

🧙‍♂️ Conjuring Nginx

First, if Nginx is not already guarding your server, summon it with:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install nginx
```
📜 Crafting the Spell (Configuration)

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
```

Use your favorite text editor to create a new scroll (file) named after your project:

sudo nano yourprojectname

Add the follwoing configuration:
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
Don't forget to enable your Nginx configuration in sites-enabled:

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourprojectname /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

To check your Nginx configuration is working:

sudo systemctl status nginx

when makin gchanges, reload and erstart your nginx for the changes to take place:

sudo systemctl restat nginx

## 🚀 Step 5: Deploying with Gunicorn 🦄
After setting up Nginx as your reverse proxy, it’s time to conjure up Gunicorn, the Green Unicorn, to serve your Flask application to the world with grace and strength. Follow these steps to summon and configure Gunicorn.

📦 Install Gunicorn

If you haven't already, install Gunicorn by running the following enchantment in your terminal:

```
pip install gunicorn
```

🌟 Running Your Application with Gunicorn Navigate to your project’s root directory, where your main Flask file (e.g., app.py) is located. Cast the following spell to awaken Gunicorn and start serving your application:

```
sudo gunicorn --workers=1 filename:app
```

if your file is app.py, instead of filename you will put app

## 🔒Step 6: Enchanting Your Application with SSL Certificates 🛡️✨

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates are crucial for protecting your application's data during transfer over the internet. They encrypt the data sent between your server and your users' browsers, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and inaccessible to malicious entities. In this step, we'll guide you through the process of obtaining a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt and configuring Nginx to use it, adding an extra layer of security to your Shieldmail application.

### 🧙‍♂️ Obtain an SSL Certificate with Certbot
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
```

### 📜 Adjust the Nginx Configuration to Use SSL

```
# Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    # Listen on port 443 for SSL connections
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on;

    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    # SSL certificate and key paths (replace with your actual paths provided by Certbot)
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    # Include the SSL configuration from Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    # Your project's public directory or root, adjust if necessary
    root /var/www/yourprojectname;

    # Proxy pass configuration for the Flask application
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; # Assuming Gunicorn runs on port 8000
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # Logging
    access_log /var/log/nginx/yourprojectname_access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/yourprojectname_error.log;
}
```
